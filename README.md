#installation
Make sure you have python3 and pip3 installed, you can install pip3  via `sudo apt install python3-pip` and install acpi via `sudo apt install acpi`
then run `pip3 install PyGObject`
after that you can run it via `python3 ~/battery-prompt/battery\ calculate.py`

I reccomend running at the start of your desktop enviorment/ window manager session here i have linked guides to run commands at start on some desktop enviorments and window managers:
